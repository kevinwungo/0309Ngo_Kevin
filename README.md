# About Me
  ## Passionate Economics Student
Hi, my name is Kevin and I'm an economics student at the University of Nevada, Reno. I'm focusing on econometrics because I like the challenge that comes with it. I'm interested in quantitative finance.
Fun fact about me is that I started a marketing business at the age of 17 and scaled it to 6 figures.
